# Front-End Development Curriculum for #100DaysOfCode

This is a somewhat opinionated curriculum for learning front-end development during #100DaysOfCode. As it covers a wide range of front-end develpoment topics, it can be thought of as more of a "survey" style course rather than a deep dive into any one area. Ideally, your takeaway from completing this curriculum will be some familiarity with each topic and the ability to easily dive deeper in any area in the future when necessary.

This curriculum was influenced significantly by Kamran Ahmed's excellent [Modern Frontend Developer](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-4c2072fa2b9c) roadmap. Please check it out--it is an excellent.

# The Details

Below you can find a little information about each topic in the curriculum as well as some ideas/guidance on what to do for each.

## HTML

### Definition

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML))

### Quick Takeaway

## CSS

### Definition

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets))

### Quick Takeaway

## JavaScript Basics

### Definition

JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript))

### Quick Takeaway

## jQuery

### Definition

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. (Source: [jQuery.com](https://jquery.com/))

### Quick Takeaway

After you have spent some time with plain (also called "vanilla") javascript, you may find some tasks a bit cumbersome, especially those related to accessing and manipulating HTML elements. For quite a while, jQuery was the go-to library for making these kinds of tasks easier and consistent across different browsers. Nowadays, jQuery isn't necessarily "mandatory" learning because of advancements in vanilla javascript, CSS, and newer javascript frameworks (we'll look at frameworks later). Still, it would be beneficial to take a little time to learn some jQuery and apply it to a small project.
